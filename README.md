Today is April 14, 2025, and Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona have already contested their UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg. WHERE: Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, Barcelona WHEN: April 9, 2025 RESULT: Barcelona 4-0 Dortmund ​
The return leg is set for April 15, 2025, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. (Barcelona leads aggregate 4-0 so Dortmund must overcome this to progress) ​
Main developments ahead of the second leg:
Injuries: Borussia Dortmund central defender Nico Schlotterbeck returned from the World Cup with a torn meniscus and the reality of a season lost to the injury; he will be out until at least April, an enormous loss for Dortmund's back line. Barcelona: Injury concerns include left-back Alejandro Balde, who looks set for a three-week lay-off with a hamstring injury, which will put his involvement in the upcoming matches, including the Champions League second leg, in doubt. ​
Suspension: Barcelona’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away from a suspension that would see him miss the semi-finals. He should expect to play less in the game this week because of this penalizing situation. ​

Borussia Dortmund are now officially up against the walls as Barcelona takes a commanding lead in the aggregate score. For fans around the world, the question will be whether Dortmund can fight back or if Barcelona will book their spot in the semis.
Team Form
Barcelona: Undefeated in 2025 in all competitions, with 19 wins and four draws. And they currently sit first in La Liga, and are favoured for the Champions League title.

Barcelona:
The starting XI is: Szczesny; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Martin; Pedri, De Jong; Yamal, Lopez, Raphinha; Lewandowski

Match Outlook
Meanwhile in the return leg, Borussia Dortmund will need something special to turn the tie around. An early goal could swing the momentum their way, but penetrating Barcelona’s staunch, tight-knit defense will prove a challenge. May also switch up their holding while keeping up the high pressing and attacking play that could easily book their semi-final spot.

Likely Outcome: Barcelona win or draw
